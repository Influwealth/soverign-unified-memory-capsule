# Sovereign Unified Memory Capsule (SUMC)

The Sovereign Unified Memory Capsule is a core module of WealthBridge OS that introduces a sovereign, software-defined memory fabric. Instead of relying on physical RAM availability, SUMC creates a virtualized memory mesh across devices, nodes, and sovereign compute clusters.

This capsule is designed to be:
- Beginner-friendly  
- Modular  
- Scalable  
- Sovereign  
- Youth-accessible  
- Ready for global deployment  

SUMC integrates directly with InfraFlow QNet, NVQLink, NIMS vGPU, VaultGemma encryption, the Observability Capsule, and the Rewards Capsule.

## What SUMC Does
- Pools memory across devices  
- Allocates memory at the capsule level  
- Encrypts all memory lanes  
- Predicts bottlenecks using quantum agents  
- Enables low-end devices to run high-end workloads  
- Supports sovereign compute for nations and communities
