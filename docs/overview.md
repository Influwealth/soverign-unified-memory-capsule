# Overview: Sovereign Unified Memory Capsule (SUMC)

The Sovereign Unified Memory Capsule is a software-defined memory layer for WealthBridge OS. It addresses the global RAM crisis by orchestrating memory across devices instead of relying on hardware upgrades.

## Why SUMC Matters
- DRAM supply is collapsing due to AI demand  
- Consumer RAM is becoming expensive and scarce  
- Legacy architectures waste memory through duplication  
- Nations need sovereign compute that does not depend on global supply chains  

SUMC solves this through:
- Memory pooling  
- Capsule-level allocation  
- Encryption  
- Observability  
- Quantum-assisted optimization  
- Incentivized participation via the Rewards Capsule  

SUMC is the memory backbone of the sovereign mesh.
