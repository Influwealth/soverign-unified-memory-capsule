# How SUMC Works

SUMC introduces a sovereign memory fabric built on five layers:

## 1. Mesh Daemon
Runs on each device and exposes available memory to the sovereign mesh.

## 2. Memory Scheduler
Allocates memory to capsules based on:
- Priority  
- Capsule type  
- Device capabilities  
- Sovereign policy  

## 3. Encryption Layer
All memory lanes are encrypted using VaultGemma.

## 4. QNet Integration
SUMC becomes Lane 3 of InfraFlow QNet:
- Lane 1: Compute  
- Lane 2: Storage  
- Lane 3: Memory  
- Lane 4: Quantum  
- Lane 5: Compliance  

## 5. Quantum Optimization
Cat Qubit + Quantum Ops predict bottlenecks and reroute workloads.

SUMC is not hardware-dependent. It is architecture-dependent.
